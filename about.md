# EcoLogic Manager: Comprehensive Overview

## What is EcoLogic Manager?
EcoLogic Manager is a highly flexible, open-source automation platform designed for the ESP8266 microcontroller. It enables users to create smart, connected devices that can be controlled, monitored, and automated via a web-based HTTP interface, MQTT, and integration with popular home automation systems like Home Assistant and Node-RED. The system is tailored for DIY enthusiasts, makers, and integrators who want to manage electrical loads, sensors, and actuators in a home or industrial environment without deep coding knowledge.

- **Pin Configuration:** Flexible pin setup for digital/analog I/O, PWM, sensors (DHT, DS18B20, MQ7, etc.), relays, and more.
- **MQTT Support:** Full MQTT client for integration with cloud brokers and local servers, supporting both status reporting and remote control.
- **Home Automation Integration:** Ready for Home Assistant, Node-RED, and other automation platforms via MQTT and HTTP REST APIs.
- **IR & RF Support:** Receive and transmit IR (infrared) and 433MHz RF codes for remote control and automation.
- **Email & Notification:** Send email alerts directly from the device for alarms or status changes.
- **Modular & Extensible:** Easily add new sensors, actuators, and logic via configuration files and modular code structure.
- **Data Storage:** Uses local files (SPIFFS/LittleFS) for persistent configuration and state.

## Device Control & Integration
### HTTP API
- **Direct Pin Control:**
  - Example: `http://<device_ip>/sendAJAX?json={"t":0,"v":1}` — Set pin 0 to HIGH.
  - Read status: `http://<device_ip>/aRest?Json={stat:0}`
- **IR/RF Code Management:**
  - Learn, send, and manage codes via HTTP endpoints.
- **Email Sending:**
  - Example: `http://<device_ip>/sendEmail?Email=MessageText`
- **Reboot/Time Sync:**
  - Example: `http://<device_ip>/function?json={reboot:1}`

### MQTT Topics
- **Status Topic:** `<deviceID>/<pin>/status` — Publishes pin state changes.
- **Control Topic:** `<deviceID>/<pin>` — Receives commands to change pin state.
- **Customizable Prefix:** All topics can be prefixed (e.g., `/IoTmanager/dev01/0/status`).

### Home Assistant & Node-RED
- **Discovery:** Manual or automatic entity creation using MQTT topics.
- **Automation:** Use device topics in automations, flows, and dashboards.
